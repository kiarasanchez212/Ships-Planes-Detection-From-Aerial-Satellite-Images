# Ships-Planes-Detection-From-Aerial-Satellite-Images

In this project I have developed an IA Neuronal Network capable of detecting and clasifiying aerial images from planes and ships also adding a YOLO procedurement.


## But how...? 🚀

I have used the following images repositories in order to train, validate and test the IA Neuronal Network and YOLO procedurements:
*For ships...*

**	https://www.kaggle.com/apollo2506/satellite-imagery-of-ships

*For planes...*
**	https://www.kaggle.com/rhammell/planesnet


### Requirements 📋🛠️

Collab and the previous datasets must be downloaded and organised in folders in your Drive account.


### Conclusions 

After creating the model and training it, it has been obtained an approximately 98% accuracy when identifying and clasifying the images, so I can afirm that this IA Neuronal Network's predictions are worth considering.
